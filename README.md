# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

Magnet Monopoly

By: Harvin Mumick and Himanee Hendre


For our final project, we created a Magnet version of Monopoly. The Monopoly we coded is made to have visuals, but since there is lots of code in our while loop that has to be updated in the pygame window, the window is unable to respond quick enough. However, the python part of the game works. It is coded exactly the same as normal Monopoly, except there is no trading and you cannot mortgage. Everything else works exactly the same as regular Monopoly, where you buy property, put houses on it, and hopefully win. Enjoy!
